# 2D-Dodge-GameÂ 
Welcome to our 2D Game Project, an exciting adventure in game development using C++ and OpenGL. In this game, players take control of two agents, A1 and A2, and guide them through an ever-changing world. Our mission is to navigate these agents while avoiding enemy objects, E1 and E2, and score points along the way.
